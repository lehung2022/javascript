      <p>My name is Le Hung</p>
      <p>
        Let me tell you my journey of understanding the red pill content <br>I
        used to be a blue pill stupid s***head <br>Then, something hit me
        hard. It's called "Reality" <br>After reality hit me hard, I came to
        realise, that women, especially 9 and 10 bitches, are a bunch of
        HEADACHES. They are not worth the cooche.......at all. <br>I don't
        understand why the world nowadays is so crazy, that people can no longer
        actually trust one another. <br>I live in Vietnam, the country of the
        Communists. I can see very clear why people can't trust one another.
        But, places like the <abbr title="United States">US</abbr>? Since when
        did they let the Communist take over their personal lives?
