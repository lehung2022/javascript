    <p>Let me tell you my journey of understanding the red pill content
      <br>I used to be a blue pill stupid s***head
      <br>Then, something hit me hard. It's called "Reality"
      <br>After reality hit me hard, I came to realise, that women, especially 9 and 10 bitches, are a bunch of HEADACHES. They are not worth the cooche.......at all.
